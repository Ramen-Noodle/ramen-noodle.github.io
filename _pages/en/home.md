My name is Christopher Lee, and I'm an incoming graduate student at NC State University pursuing a Master's in Computer Science.

I've particularly come to enjoy Web Development through my undergraduate experience, and as a graduate student I hope to delve into the worlds of AI and Machine Learning, and possibly even some Game Development.

Outside of programming, I have a strong interest in music and playing instruments, linguistics, and travel. You may see a blog post about one of these interests from time to time!

Thanks for checking out my website! Here you can see some of the experience I've had, as well as some projects that I've worked on. Of course, I will be adding to these more in the future!
