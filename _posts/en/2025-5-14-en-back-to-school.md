Around this time last May, I was walking across the stage at my graduation, prepared to receive my diploma after four years of hard work. This year, I'm gearing up to go back, to the very same school in fact.

While I was finishing my last year as an undergrad, I figured that I would want nothing more than to get out of school and get working. After all, if I really wanted to I could always do grad school after a couple of years. And that was the plan, but the next six months would change things. One internship, a house move, and a knee surgery later, I found that it was the time of year when most graduate programs opened up their applications. So rather than waiting any longer, I decided that 2025 would be a great year to go back for my master’s.

Fast forward a few more months, and I got word from NC State that I had been accepted into the Computer Science master’s program. I was not only very excited, but also more than a little relieved to know that I had my plan set for the Fall. I could rest easy for a moment and begin planning for the next two years of my education.

A big part of why I’m so excited to go back, despite how I felt about grad school before, is the chance to make up for missed opportunities. Not only did I not get the chance to take all of the classes that I wanted to, but Covid-19 had pushed my freshman year off campus, and readjusting afterwards took a long time as well. As such, when I reflected on my time in school, it looked incomplete, like I hadn’t taken full advantage of those four years. To me, getting my master’s is not only a chance to learn more, but also a chance to reset in a way. It’ll be another two years for me to build new skills, set up my future career, and fully finish my college experience in a way that will feel complete.

Of course, I’m also looking forward to experiencing the new things that come with grad school too. And as I experience them, I’d like to share my thoughts here on this blog. I suspect that I won’t always have time to do so, but when I do I will be sure to put up a post or two.
